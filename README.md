# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
I wrote a basic Alien Invaders type game, using vaguely star wars-inspired graphics to represent the player and the enemies. You move your player around using either the left and right arrow keys or the A and D keys,using the space-bar to shoot and the left shift key to rotate which weapon type youre using. 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I built this game as evidence to myself that even with incredibly limited knowledge about game design and PyGame, it is still possible to build quite a decent game.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1: Ideally I'd like to add variable score boosts for different enemies, higher score for harder enemies.
* Item 2: Secret Boss needs work, id like it to move more slowly, but seeing as all requirements were already met, I elected to abandon that idea.
* Item 3: I'd like to add things like temporary power ups and being able to add kmore weapons to your arsenal.
